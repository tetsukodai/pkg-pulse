# plan.aide Spec

The architect's implementation plan. A `plan.aide` lives next to the `.aide` intent spec it implements — same folder, progressive disclosure tells the implementor which intent it serves.

## Format

```yaml
---
intent: >
  One-line summary of what this plan delivers. Mirrors the `.aide` intent
  but scoped to the concrete work this plan covers — enough for the
  implementor to know at a glance what they are building.
---
```

```markdown
## Plan

### 1. Step title — self-contained unit

Read: `coding-playbook/structure/modularization`, `coding-playbook/patterns/orchestrator-helper`

- [ ] What to do, which files, what contracts

### 2. Coupled step title — requires shared context

Read: `coding-playbook/testing/unit-tests`

- [ ] 2a. First action in the coupled group
- [ ] 2b. Second action that depends on 2a's in-memory state
- [ ] 2c. Third action completing the group

### 3. Another independent step

- [ ] What to do

## Decisions

Architectural choices made during planning: why X over Y, naming rationale,
tradeoffs accepted. The implementor reads this to understand the reasoning
without re-deriving it.
```

## Rules

- **Frontmatter is minimal.** `intent` only. No `status`, no `spec` pointer — the plan lives next to the spec it implements, and progressive disclosure makes the relationship obvious.
- **Every step gets a checkbox.** The implementor checks each box as it completes during `/aide:build`. Unchecked boxes are pending work; checked boxes are done.
- **Steps execute top-to-bottom.** Sequencing is the architect's job. The implementor does not reorder, skip, or add steps. If a step is ambiguous, escalate back to `/aide:plan`. Each numbered step is executed by a fresh implementor agent. Lettered sub-steps within a number share a single agent session.
- **Each numbered step is a unit of delegation.** The orchestrator spawns one fresh implementor agent per numbered step. This means each step must be self-contained: a fresh agent should be able to execute it by reading the plan, the `.aide` spec, and the current code state — without knowing what a prior agent did in-memory. Write steps at a granularity where each one produces a complete, testable change.
- **Lettered sub-steps for coupled work.** When multiple actions are tightly coupled and cannot be executed independently (e.g., creating a helper and immediately wiring it into the caller), group them as lettered sub-steps under a single number: `1a`, `1b`, `1c`. The orchestrator keeps one agent for all sub-steps of a given number. Use this sparingly — most steps should be independent. If you find yourself lettering more than you're numbering, the steps are too granular.
- **No implementation code.** No function bodies, no business logic, no algorithms, no worked examples, no copy-paste snippets. Steps describe decisions — file names, contracts, sequencing, reuse. The implementor writes the code and loads conventions directly from the playbook via the step's `Read:` list.
- **Every step has a Read list.** Each numbered step must open with a `Read:` line listing 1-3 coding playbook notes from the brain that the implementor should read before coding that step. These are the **convention notes** — playbook rules that govern how the implementor writes the code for that step (decomposition, naming, file size, patterns, testing style). The architect already consulted the playbook during planning; the Read list tells the implementor exactly which notes to load so it applies the same conventions. The implementor has direct playbook access via the `study-playbook` skill and will read these notes itself — the architect does not need to encode convention details into the plan text.
- **Every step traces to intent.** Each step must be traceable back to a line in the `.aide` spec, a rule in the coding playbook, or the [progressive disclosure](./progressive-disclosure.md) conventions (orchestrator/helper pattern, modularization, cascading structure). If a step has no source, cut it or find the rule that justifies it.
- **Tests are steps.** Every behavior the spec's `outcomes.desired` names gets a corresponding test step in the plan.
- **Decisions section is not optional.** The architect records *why* each structural choice was made. This prevents the implementor from second-guessing decisions mid-build and prevents future architects from re-debating settled choices.
- **Read lists are not optional.** The architect consults the playbook during planning and encodes the relevant conventions as a `Read:` list pointing the implementor to the specific playbook notes that govern each step. The implementor has direct playbook access and will load those notes itself. The architect's job is to pick the right notes, not to transcribe their contents into the plan.

## Lifecycle

1. **Created** by the architect agent during `/aide:plan`.
2. **Presented to the user** for approval before `/aide:build` begins. The orchestrator pauses here.
3. **Consumed** by the implementor during `/aide:build` — checkboxes track progress.
4. **Retained** after build completes — the plan is an audit trail of what was decided and why.

## Placement

`plan.aide` lives next to the `.aide` it implements:

```
src/service/<feature>/
├── .aide          ← intent spec
├── plan.aide      ← implementation plan
├── index.ts
└── ...
```

No cross-referencing needed. The folder is the relationship.
